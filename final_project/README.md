## Project and Data Description

Precarious manhood is the idea that manhood is an achieved social status that is difficult to procure and maintain and easy to lose. Its tenuousness is a source of anxiety that results in lots of compensatory behaviors: When masculinity is threatened, men may engage in aggressive behaviors to 'prove' their manhood. Furthermore, in the US, men, on average, feel more existentially isolated than women. They tend to believe that others do not share their subjective experiences, which stymies the fundamental need to belong and epistemic needs. This is the second of 2 studies to examine whether the existential isolation experienced by men is associated with a mismatch between their own perception of the precariousness of manhood and their perception of others' endorsement of precarious manhood.

The data were collected from USF students over the past 3 semesters and include the following variables:

* Existential isolation (EI)
* Precarious manhood (PM)
* False consensus
* Communal values
* Conformity to masculine norms
* Independent self-construal
* Aggression
* Demographics
