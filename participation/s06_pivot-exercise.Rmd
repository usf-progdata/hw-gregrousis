## Exercise 1: Univariate Pivoting

Consider the Lord of the Rings data:

```{r}
lotr
```

1. Would you say this data is in tidy format?

   Nope, for the data to be in tidy format, each row must be one observation, each column a variable, and each cell a
   value. 

2. Widen the data so that we see the words spoken by each species, by putting species as its own column.

```{r}
(lotr_wide <- lotr %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(-Species, -Words), 
              names_from = Species, 
              values_from = Words))
```

3. Re-lengthen the wide LOTR data from Question 2 above.

```{r}
lotr_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Elf, Hobbit, Man), 
               names_to  = "species", 
               values_to = "n")
```
